# DawaChain: Combating Counterfeit Drugs with Blockchain

DawaChain is a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution designed to tackle the pervasive issue of counterfeit drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. By leveraging innovative technologies such as blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and SMS verification, DawaChain aims to ensure the authenticity of pharmaceutical products from manufacturer to consumer.

## Key Features

### Hybrid Blockchain Architecture

DawaChain will utilize a hybrid blockchain architecture, combining both public and private blockchains. This architecture will provide the transparency and integrity needed for tracking drug provenance, while also ensuring the security of sensitive information.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

To protect user privacy while verifying the authenticity of drugs, DawaChain will implement zero-knowledge proofs. This technology will allow verification without revealing sensitive information about the drug or its supply chain history.

### SMS Verification

Customers will be able to verify the authenticity of drugs by sending a unique code via SMS. The system will respond with a confirmation message indicating whether the drug is genuine or counterfeit, providing a simple and accessible verification method.

### Token-Based Model

DawaChain will implement a token-based model to incentivize participation in the network. Tokens can be earned by verifying products and can be used for transaction fees or accessing certain features of the system.

### APIs and Integration Tools

To facilitate integration with existing systems, DawaChain will provide APIs and integration tools. This will allow for seamless data exchange between the blockchain network and other systems, enhancing interoperability.

## How It Works

1. **Product Registration:** Manufacturers will register their products on the blockchain, providing details such as batch numbers, expiration dates, and unique identifiers.

2. **Transaction Tracking:** As products move through the supply chain, each transaction (receipt, transfer, sale) will be recorded on the blockchain. This will enable distributors and retailers to track the entire transaction history of a drug.

3. **SMS Verification:** Customers can verify the authenticity of a drug by sending a unique code via SMS. The system will check the blockchain for the code and respond with a confirmation message.

4. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** To ensure privacy, zero-knowledge proofs will be used to verify the authenticity of a product without revealing sensitive information.

5. **Token Usage:** Tokens earned by users can be used for transaction fees or accessing certain features of the system, incentivizing participation.

## Conclusion

DawaChain represents a significant step forward in the fight against counterfeit drugs. By leveraging blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs, and SMS verification, DawaChain aims to provide a secure and transparent way to authenticate pharmaceutical products, ultimately ensuring patient safety and trust in the industry.
